# AISNA

## Description 

**AISNA** (or *Admin IS Not Admin*) is a project inspired from the Person of Interest TV series and more specifically from this excerpt from an episode (S4xE05):  

[![Admin is not Admin](http://img.youtube.com/vi/nhWe2nf24ag/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhWe2nf24ag "Person of Interest - Admin is not Admin")

AISNA is a deep learning algorithm which use **live faces recognition** to determine if the person on camera is either an admin or an unknown person. It also uses **voice recognition** to show more features on the broadcast if certain words are used.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The virtualenv package is required to create virtual environments. You can install it with pip:
```sh
    pip install virtualenv
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Scylidose/AISNA.git
```

2. Create virtual environment
```sh
    virtualenv myvenv
```

3. Activate virtual environment

```sh
    .\myvenv\\Scripts\activate
```

4. Install requirements

```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
